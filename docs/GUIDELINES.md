# Plugins
We should never use external plugins. What I mean by this is that things like EssentialsX,
or similar massive plugins should not be needed. The only plugins that should ever be used,
are library plugins (e.g.[Creative](https://github.com/unnamed/creative) and its many addons) or things like the Vivecraft Spigot Extensions.
These dependencies must be shaded! There should only ever be one plugin in the Plugins folder.
# Styling Guidelines
Follow the Kotlin Styling Guidelines (the ones IntelliJ IDEA forces on you)
# Development
As I am the only developer on this project, it will be put on hold, until I am done with my main project (for school).
After that, I will make sure to work through the [todo](TODO.md).
