# Reasoning
Streamers get harassed during their streams sometimes. On top of that, sometimes the Minecraft chat is abused
to talk to the streamer, instead of communicating game relevant information to other players.
# Solution
Streamers should get access to a command, that toggles a sort of streamer mode, that makes it so other people can't interact with them anymore.
The streamers client should receive the appropriate packets to make it think it is on the server alone.
It should also be possible for the streamer to "enable" other players, making them visible again, as well as their chat messages being sent again.
