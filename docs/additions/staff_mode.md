# Reasoning
There have been concerns raised about staff cheating. Adding a staff mode, meaning staff only have extra permissions in this specific mode, would help resolve those concerns.
# Solution
Staff should have access to a command to toggle their status between staff mode and playing mode.
Changing from playing mode to staff mode should give you administrative privileges. It should also start recording all actions taken by the staff member.
These actions should then be logged. When the staff member switches back into playing mode, the inventory should be restored
to the state it was in, before enabling staff mode.
